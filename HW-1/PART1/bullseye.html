<!--
Using the HTML5 Canvas API, develop the application to draw the
following pattern with the files bullsEye.html and bullsEye.js. Use the
canvas of size 400 x 400. Use a loop to draw the pattern, alternating
between red and blue filled circles. Use the initial band width value of 25.
Repeat the loop as long as the current radius is greater than 0. Use a
slider to control the band width. The slider has a minimum value of 5,
maximum value of 50 with step 5, and current value as 25. As the value of
the slider changes, draw the pattern with the current bandwidth. The
output will appear as shown below for different slider values. (See the
sliderExample.html in Module1 Canvas samples)
