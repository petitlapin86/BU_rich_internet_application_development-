<!--
When the user clicks with the mouse on the canvas, a filled circle of size of 30 is
drawn at the clicked point. A random color is used for each mouse click. (See the
randomColor.html in Module1 Canvas samples for generating random color).
Write the code in the files circles1.html and circles1.js. Use a canvas of size 400
x 400.
Modify the application so that any overlapping circles are hidden when a new
circle is being drawn at the clicked point as shown in the following link. Write the
code in the files circles2.html and circles2.js.
