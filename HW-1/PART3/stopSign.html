Using the HTML5 SVG API, draw the following in the file stopSign.html.
Define a svg area of size 500 x 300. In the defs section, group a red polygon and
the text for the STOP sign shape and assign an id for this group. The coordinates
of the polygon may be approximate.
Using the defined group, draw the following.
The first stop sign shape drawn is the correct one installed by your municipality.
The second shape is the one where a kid decided to rotate the shape 90 degrees
clockwise from the normal.
The third shape is the one where a kid decided to rotate the shape 180 degrees
clockwise from the normal.
The fourth one is an animation where the kid decided to give the shape a spin.
